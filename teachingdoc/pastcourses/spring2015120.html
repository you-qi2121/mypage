<hr><b>Peer Tutors:</b><br>
Peer tutors are undergraduates associated specifically with Math 120 (these are different from college tutors listed below). Their primary job is to have private appointments with anyone who wants their help. You can e-mail any one of them for an appointment, just for yourself, or go in with a small group of friends. Each tutor also holds office hours for anyone to stop by and meet them, go over troublesome topics, or ask for homework hints.
This semester, our peer tutors are:<br>
