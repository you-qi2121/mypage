<hr><b>Course Description:</b><br>
This course is a continuation of Math 151a, which was focused on fundamental groups and homology. This quarter will be devoted to the study of cohomology and higher homotopy groups. More precisely, we will cover important topics including the universal coefficient theorem, cup products, Poincare duality, homotopy groups of fibrations etc.


<hr><b>Textbooks:</b><br>
We will be using Allen Hatcher's textbook <a href="https://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Algebraic Topology</a>. Our course will cover Chapters III and IV of the textbook.<br>
<br>

Some other useful references:

<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4757-3951-0.pdf">Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology</a> by Bott and Tu. This more differential topologically flavored textbook is more useful for students oriented towards applying algebraic topology in the study of algebraic geometry, differential geoemetry and mathematical physics. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-23488-5.pdf">Homotopic Topology</a> by Formenko and Fuchs. This book is more homotopy theory oriented, and the first chapter can be used as a supplement to our course. <br>
