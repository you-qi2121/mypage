<hr><b>Course Description:</b><br>
This course is aimed at giving a gentle introduction to noncommutative algebra. We aim to illustrate basic principles of abstract algebra via representation theory of some finite groups and finite-dimensional Lie algebras.

<hr><b>Prerequisites:</b><br>
Basic undergraduate level abstract algebra, commutative algebra as in the first part of the course, some famliarity with finite groups, character theory will be assumed (see the first two chapters of [1]).
