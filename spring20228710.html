Time and Venue: Every Tue, Thu 11:00-12:15, 317 Kerchoff.  <br>
Office Hour: Mon/Wed 10:30-11:30am or by email appointments.<br>

<hr><b>Course Description:</b><br>
This course is aimed at giving a gentle introduction to Lie algebras. Our main goal is to have a basic understanding of the fundamental subject of complex semisimple Lie algebras, their origins and their representation theory. We will cover: <br>
<li> Basics of topological groups, Lie group. Why Lie algebras? </li> 
<li> Nilpotent and Solvable Lie algebras </li> 
<li> Represention theory of sl(2) </li> 
<li> Semisimple Lie algebras </li>
<li> Root systems, Dykin diagrams, classification of semisimple Lie algebras </li>
<li> Representations of semisimple Lie algebras </li>
<li> Weyl character formula and applications </li>



<hr><b>Prerequisites:</b><br>
Advanced linear algebra (Math 4651 level) and basic familiarity with notions of groups, rings and modules.
